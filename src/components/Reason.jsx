            <p className='font-satoshi font-medium text-sm text-center'>An outline helps you organize the main ideas and sub-ideas in your article. By pre-determining how each section will be organized, you can ensure that your article has a logical structure and is easy for readers to follow. This helps avoid the appearance of a random or disorganized article.</p>

            <p className='font-satoshi font-medium text-sm text-center'>The outline serves as a guide during the writing process. When you have an outline of what you will write in each section, it will be easier for you to write fluently without getting confused or losing focus. It also helps you stay on topic without getting too digressive.</p>
